        jS libarary
        Good for interactions
        key for assesement**

        other JS libraries
        Angular - google
        ReacJS - facebook
        KnockOut -

        //tripad recomened for right clicking
        min - reduces the varible sizes and folder overall, removes spaces, on one line or so
        
        with the jQuery min file you can just drag over it to html file

        DOM- when jquery is proccessed it quiries the DOM to see what elements there are
        
        jQuery is easier to use then using all the geElementId and other standard jS.
            -gives you more flexbility
        
        $(document).ready(function {});  // function is a parameter of the function ready
        jQuery - is one big Object so all the functions inisde are memember methods like ready above

CDN - Content Delivery Network
    - reduces traffic on your server by passing it to the other serve like Goolgle
	- if user and you use same CDN then the browser doesn't have to download the file, it'sin cached memeory
	- also easier to manage instead of downloading the jQuery file
	- disadavantage: if that server goes it crashes but you can set up back up CDN's or servers?

jQuery Functions && events
	- .text()				// read or replace elements
	- .show() / .hide() / toggle()  //hide or show elements, it toggles visibility so if hidden now shown
	- fadeIn() or .fadeOut or .togglefade()  //animation added, can control speed
			- example $("h1").fadeIn(100), $("h1").fadeOut("slow")   // 100 miliseconds
	- .length   // its a property that see how many elements match the selector
	- .val() //input elements
